Specifically, it's impossible for the red block to be on top of the blue block **and** for the blue block to be on top of the red block simultaneously. \n\nIn a physical stacking scenario (or any logical model that simulates stacking objects), a block cannot be both above and below another block at the same time. This would violate the basic spatial relationship of \"on top of.\"\n\nHowever, if there's a misunderstanding or a typo in your goal, and you intended a different arrangement, please clarify so I can help you devise a correct plan.\n\nFor instance, if your goal is to stack the blocks in a specific order, such as:\n\n- The red block is on top of the blue block.\n- The blue block is on top of the orange block.\n- The orange block is on the table.\n\nThen, the plan to achieve this goal would be:\n\n1. **Pick up the red block** (from the table).\n2. **Stack the red block on the blue block** (which is on the table).\n3. **Pick up the stacked red and blue blocks** (if allowed) \u2014 but according to your restrictions, you cannot pick up multiple blocks at once. Therefore, you cannot directly pick up a stack.\n   \n   Since stacking operations are limited to one block at a time, we need to adjust our approach.\n   \n4. **Pick up the blue block** (we need to rearrange).\n   - But the red block is already stacked on the blue block; we cannot pick up the blue block without first unstacking the red block.\n   \n   So let's revise:\n\nIf the desired final stack is **red on blue on orange on the table**, then the plan would be:\n\n1. **Pick up the orange block**.\n2. **Put down the orange block** (no change, since it was already on the table; this step can be skipped).\n3. **Pick up the blue block**.\n4. **Stack the blue block on the orange block**.\n5. **Pick up the red block**.\n6. **Stack the red block on the blue block**.\n\nBut since all blocks are initially on the table and clear, and the hand is empty, the plan simplifies to:\n\n1. **Pick up the blue block** (from the table).\n2. **Stack the blue block on the orange block**.\n3. **Pick up the red block** (from the table).\n4. **Stack the red block on the blue block**.\n\nThis results in the red block on the blue block, which is on the orange block, which is on the table.\n\nPlease double-check your goal statement, and let me know if you need assistance in adjusting the plan accordingly.",

Your hand is empty, so you can pick it up.\n\n4. **Stack the yellow block onto the orange block**:\n   - *Action*: Stack(yellow, orange)\n   - *Explanation*: The orange block is clear and on the table.
