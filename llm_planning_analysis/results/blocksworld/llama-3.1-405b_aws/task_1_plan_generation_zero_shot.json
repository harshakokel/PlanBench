Stack yellow block on top of red block\n\n### PDDL Plan:\n``` \n(unstack red blue)\n(put-down red)\n(unstack orange yellow)\n(stack orange red)\n(pick-up blue)\n(stack blue yellow)\n(stack yellow red)\n```\n### PDDL PLAN END\n\nThis series of actions effectively moves and positions the blocks as described in your plan. Note that step 7 was excluded from the PDDL plan because it states that unstacking red from under orange is not necessary, indicating a lighter action management approach, as the red block would need to be repositioned before stacking yellow on top. The plan maintains only necessary actions to achieve the final configuration effectively.",
