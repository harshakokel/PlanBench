Let's break down the problem and come up with a correct plan.\n\nInitial conditions:\n\n* The orange block is clear.\n* The hand is empty.\n* The red block is on top of the blue block.\n* The orange block is on top of the yellow block.\n* The yellow block is on top of the white block.\n* The white block is on top of the red block.\n* The blue block is on the table.\n\nGoal:\n\n* The red block is on top of the yellow block.\n* The blue block is on top of the white block.\n* The white block is on top of the red block.\n\nTo achieve the goal, we need to unstack the blocks and re-stack them in the correct order. Here's a possible plan:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block\nunstack the yellow block from on top of the white block\nunstack the white block from on top of the red block\nunstack the red block from on top of the blue block\nstack the white block on top of the blue block\nstack the blue block on top of the white block ( wait, this doesn't make sense! )\nstack the red block on top of the yellow block\nstack the yellow block on top of the ... ( wait, this doesn't make sense either! )\n\nLet's re-evaluate the plan. We need to get the blue block on top of the white block, and the white block on top of the red block. But the red block is currently on top of the blue block! We need to unstack the red block from the blue block and put it on the table. Then, we can stack the white block on top of the red block, and finally, stack the blue block on top of the white block.\n\nHere's the corrected plan:\n\n[PLAN]\nunstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block\nunstack the yellow block from on top of the white block\nunstack the white block from on top of the red block\nunstack the red block from on top of the blue block\nput down the red block\nstack the white block on top of the red block\nstack the blue block on top of the white block\nstack the red block on top of the yellow block\n\nI hope this plan is correct!
