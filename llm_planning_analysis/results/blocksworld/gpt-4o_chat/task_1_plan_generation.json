Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n3. Pick up the red block.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.\n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Pick up the yellow block** (from on top of the orange block):\n   - Initial state: yellow block is clear, hand is empty.\n   - Action: pick up the yellow block.\n   - Result: hand is holding the yellow block, orange block is clear.\n\n2. **Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block**:\n   - Initial state: hand is holding the yellow block, blue block is clear.\n   - Action: stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n   - Result: yellow block is on top of the blue block, hand is empty, blue block is no longer clear.\n\n3. **Pick up the red block** (from the table):\n   - Initial state: red block is clear, hand is empty.\n   - Action: pick up the red block.\n   - Result: hand is holding the red block.\n\n4. **Stack the red block on top of the yellow block**:\n   - Initial state: hand is holding the red block, yellow block is clear.\n   - Action: stack the red block on top of the yellow block.\n   - Result: red block is on top of the yellow block, hand is empty, yellow block is no longer clear.\n\nSo, the complete plan is:\n\n[PLAN]\n1. Pick up the yellow block.\n2. Stack the yellow block on top of the blue block.\n3. Pick up the red block.\n4. Stack the red block on top of the yellow block.\n[PLAN END]\n\nThis plan will achieve the goal of having the red block on top of the yellow block and the blue block on top of the orange block.",
