Here's a breakdown of the plan:\n\n1-2. Remove and put down the orange block to clear the top of the stack.\n3-4. Remove and put down the red block to access the yellow block.\n5-6. Remove and put down the yellow block to expose the blue block.\n7-8. Finally, pick up the orange block and stack it on top of the blue block, achieving the goal.\n\nThis plan ensures that each step follows the rules about hand occupancy, block clearance, and the allowed actions, while efficiently reaching the desired configuration.",
