Unstacking it frees the red block so it can be moved.\n\n4. **Put down the orange block on the table.**\n   - *Reasoning:* Temporarily placing the orange block on the table allows you to manipulate the red block without obstruction.\n\n5. **Pick up the red block from the table.**\n   - *Reasoning:* With the red block clear and your hand empty, you can pick it up to place it on the blue block.\n\n6. **Stack the red block on top of the blue block.**\n   - *Reasoning:* This positions the red block directly on top of the blue block, as required in the goal configuration.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block from the table.**\n   - *Reasoning:* Now that the red block is in place, you can reposition the orange block.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block on top of the red block.**\n   - *Reasoning:* This places the orange block correctly in the stack, directly on top of the red block.\n\n9. **Pick up the yellow block from the table.**\n   - *Reasoning:* The yellow block is clear and ready to be moved.\n\n10. **Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block.**\n    - *Reasoning:* This completes the desired configuration by placing the yellow block on top of the stack.\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1.

Here's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Unstack the red block from the blue block:**\n   - **Action:** Unstack(Red, Blue)\n   - **Explanation:** The red block is clear and on top of the blue block. Unstacking it frees up the blue block for further manipulation.\n   \n2. **Put down the red block onto the table:**\n   - **Action:** Putdown(Red)\n   - **Explanation:** After unstacking, you're holding the red block. Putting it down clears your hand for the next action.\n\n3. **Unstack the blue block from the yellow block:**\n   - **Action:** Unstack(Blue, Yellow)\n   - **Explanation:** The blue block is now clear and can be unstacked from the yellow block beneath it.\n\n4. **Put down the blue block onto the table:**\n   - **Action:** Putdown(Blue)\n   - **Explanation:** You need to have the blue block accessible and clear on the table to stack the orange block onto it later.\n\n5. **Unstack the yellow block from the orange block:**\n   - **Action:** Unstack(Yellow, Orange)\n   - **Explanation:** The yellow block is clear and can be unstacked from the orange block, making the orange block clear.\n\n6. **Stack the yellow block onto the red block:**\n   - **Action:** Stack(Yellow, Red)\n   - **Explanation:** By stacking the yellow block onto the red block (which is on the table), you keep it out of the way and ensure it doesn't interfere with the goal.\n\n7. **Pick up the orange block from the table:**\n   - **Action:** Pickup(Orange)\n   - **Explanation:** The orange block is now clear and on the table, so you can pick it up.\n\n8. **Stack the orange block onto the blue block:**\n   - **Action:** Stack(Orange, Blue)\n   - **Explanation:** This achieves the goal of having the orange block on top of the blue block.\n\n**Summary of Actions:**\n\n1. Unstack(Red, Blue)\n2. Putdown(Red)\n3. Unstack(Blue, Yellow)\n4. Putdown(Blue)\n5. Unstack(Yellow, Orange)\n6. Stack(Yellow, Red)\n7. Pickup(Orange)\n8. Stack(Orange, Blue)\n\nThis sequence of actions rearranges the blocks while adhering to all the given restrictions, ultimately achieving your goal.",
