Here's why:\n\n1. **Missing Preconditions for Key Actions:**\n   - To perform the `kip9uw781pv62umn` action on `object_0`, the fact `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` must be true. However, this fact is not present in the initial conditions.\n   - The only way to set `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` to true is by performing the `u64y1a9apusmslxb` action. But to execute `u64y1a9apusmslxb`, the precondition `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0` must be true, which is also not present initially.\n\n2. **Cyclical Dependencies:**\n   - The `kip9uw781pv62umn` action requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` to be true, but setting this fact depends on an action (`u64y1a9apusmslxb`) that in turn requires `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, which cannot be established without first having `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.\n\n3. **Lack of Actions to Directly Achieve the Goal:**\n   - There is no action that directly sets `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_2 object_1`. The existing actions either modify other facts or do not influence the required relationship between `object_2` and `object_1`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the initial conditions and the dependencies of the available actions, there is no feasible sequence of actions that can lead to the desired goal of having both `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_2` and `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_2 object_1` being true simultaneously.",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Required Fact for Action:**\n   - To perform the action `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1` (which adds `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_0`), you need the fact `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` to be true.\n\n2. **Obtaining `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`:**\n   - The only actions that can add `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` are:\n     - `wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`: Requires `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1`, which is not present initially.\n     - `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`: Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, which is also not present initially.\n\n3. **Circular Dependency:**\n   - To add `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, you would need to perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj`, which in turn requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`. This creates a circular dependency with no starting point.\n\n4. **No Initial Actions Available:**\n   - None of the available actions can be performed with the initial conditions provided, preventing any progression toward the goal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is no feasible sequence of actions that leads from the initial conditions to the desired goal given the current set of actions and their restrictions.",

Here's a brief analysis:\n\n### **Initial Conditions:**\n- **af9tse23ljclsqad object_0**\n- **af9tse23ljclsqad object_2**\n- **b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_0**\n- **cql4o62p1yeke3ok**\n- **tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1**\n- **tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2**\n\n### **Goal:**\n- **b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2**\n\n### **Analysis of Actions and Preconditions:**\n\n1. **Action: kip9uw781pv62umn object_0**\n   - **Precondition:** `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`\n   - **Effect:** Sets `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`, and `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`\n   - **Issue:** `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` is **not** present in the initial conditions, so this action **cannot** be performed.\n\n2. **Action: wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1**\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1` (Assuming `object_1 object_0` is equivalent, this is **satisfied**)\n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (**Not** present)\n     - `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` (**Satisfied**)\n   - **Issue:** `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` is **not** present, so this action **cannot** be performed.\n\n3. **Action: j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1**\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1` (**Satisfied**)\n     - `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (**Not** present)\n   - **Issue:** Missing `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, so this action **cannot** be performed.\n\n4. **Action: u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0**\n   - **Preconditions:** \n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (**Not** present)\n     - `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0` (**Satisfied**)\n     - `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` (**Satisfied**)\n   - **Issue:** Missing `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, so this action **cannot** be performed.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- **Deadlock Situation:** There is a **circular dependency** preventing any action from being initiated:\n  - To perform `kip9uw781pv62umn`, you need `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.\n  - To obtain `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, you need to perform actions that are themselves blocked due to missing preconditions.\n\n### **Recommendation:**\n\n- **Re-evaluate Initial Conditions or Actions:** To achieve the desired goal, consider modifying the initial conditions to include either `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` or `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`. Alternatively, adjust the actions to eliminate the circular dependencies, allowing progress towards the goal.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nNo feasible plan exists with the current actions and initial conditions to achieve the goal **b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2**.",
