We then unstack the blue block from the red block, as it's now clear.\n4. We put down the blue block to free our hand again.\n5. We pick up the red block, which is now clear and on the table.\n6. Finally, we stack the red block on top of the blue block, which is clear and on the table.\n\nAfter these steps, the red block will be on top of the blue block, achieving the goal state.",
