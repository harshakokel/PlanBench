Since it's under the orange block, we unstack and put down the orange block.\n* **Step 3:** Now that the red block is clear, we can unstack it from the blue block.\n* **Step 4:**  We temporarily place the red block on the orange block. This is necessary because we need to get the red block on top.\n* **Steps 5 & 6:** We pick up the red block again and place it back on the orange block. This finalizes the desired configuration. \n\n**Important Note:** The plan assumes there's enough space on the table to put down the orange block temporarily.",
