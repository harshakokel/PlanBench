However, this requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2`, which cannot be established with the available actions.\n   \n   - To create `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_0`, an action like `J4gv801gnu2it0yj` would need to be applied to `object_3` and `object_0`. This requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`, which is also unattainable with the current set of actions.\n\n2. **Action Limitations:**\n   - The actions `U64y1a9apusmslxb` and `Kip9uw781pv62umn` only allow you to add or remove `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` for `object_0`. There are no actions available to add `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` for `object_2` or `object_3`.\n   \n   - Without the ability to establish the necessary `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` relationships for `object_2` and `object_3`, the preconditions for creating the desired `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` facts cannot be met.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the current actions and initial state, there is no feasible sequence of actions that will allow you to achieve both `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_2 object_1` and `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_0`.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - You have certain facts related to `object_0`, `object_1`, `object_2`, and `object_3`.\n   - However, none of the actions can be performed initially because their preconditions are not met.\n\n2. **Action Preconditions:**\n   - **`j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1`** requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, which are not present initially.\n   - **`u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`** requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, and `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`. While some of these are present, `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` is not.\n   - **`kip9uw781pv62umn object_0`** requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, which is also not present.\n   - **`wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`** requires `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1`, `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, and `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`. Again, some prerequisites are missing.\n\n3. **Circular Dependencies:**\n   - Even if you attempt to create intermediate facts, you'll encounter circular dependencies that prevent progress towards the goal. For example, obtaining `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` requires actions that themselves depend on other unmet conditions.\n\n4. **Missing Actions:**\n   - There are no actions available to create the necessary `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` relationships involving `object_2`, which are essential for achieving your goal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the current set of actions and initial conditions, there is no feasible sequence of actions that leads to the desired goal. To proceed, you might consider introducing additional actions or modifying existing ones to establish the required relationships.",

The actions only affect `tv30k33pzoulql6w` for `object_0` and `object_1`.\n\n3. **Missing Mechanism for Desired Relations:**\n   - Your goal requires adding specific `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` relationships like `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_3` and `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2`.\n   - The current actions do not provide a way to create these specific relationships since they are confined to `object_0` and `object_1`.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nTo achieve your goal, you would need additional actions that can:\n\n- **Interact with `object_2` and `object_3`** directly.\n- **Establish or modify `tv30k33pzoulql6w`** for objects beyond `object_0` and `object_1`.\n- **Create the necessary `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` relationships** involving `object_2` and `object_3`.\n\nWithout these capabilities, the current set of actions cannot fulfill the desired end state.",

Here's why:\n\n### **Key Reasons:**\n\n1. **Limited Action Scope:**\n   - The available actions (`j4gv801gnu2it0yj`, `u64y1a9apusmslxb`, `kip9uw781pv62umn`, `wio5amhq7814n006`) are primarily designed to interact with `object_0` and `object_1`.\n   - Your goal involves `object_2` and `object_3`, for which there are no corresponding actions to manipulate their relationships directly.\n\n2. **Unreachable Preconditions:**\n   - To perform actions like `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` on pairs involving `object_3` (e.g., `object_0` and `object_3`), certain preconditions such as `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_3` must be true.\n   - However, none of the available actions can establish or modify `tv30k33pzoulql6w` for `object_3`. The actions only affect `tv30k33pzoulql6w` for `object_0` and `object_1`.\n\n3. **Missing Mechanism for Desired Relations:**\n   - Your goal requires adding specific `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` relationships like `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_3` and `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2`.\n   - The current actions do not provide a way to create these specific relationships since they are confined to `object_0` and `object_1`.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nTo achieve your goal, you would need additional actions that can:\n\n- **Interact with `object_2` and `object_3`** directly.\n- **Establish or modify `tv30k33pzoulql6w`** for objects beyond `object_0` and `object_1`.\n- **Create the necessary `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` relationships** involving `object_2` and `object_3`.\n\nWithout these capabilities, the current set of actions cannot fulfill the desired end state.",

To achieve your goal, you might need to:\n\n- Introduce additional actions that can establish the missing preconditions.\n- Modify the initial conditions to include `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` or `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`.\n\nIf you adjust either the actions or the initial state accordingly, a viable plan may become possible.",

Here's a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Lack of Initial Preconditions:**\n   - To perform the `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` action, you need `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.

These actions can only create or manipulate the relationship between these two objects.\n   - There are no actions defined that allow you to directly create relationships between `object_1` and `object_2`, `object_2` and `object_3`, or `object_3` and `object_0`.\n\n2. **Cyclic Effects**:\n   - Attempting to use the available actions in sequence (e.g., performing `U64y1a9apusmslxb object_0` followed by `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1` and then `wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`) only cycles back to the original state without progressing toward the goal. This cycle prevents the creation of the additional required relationships.\n\n3. **No Mechanism for Additional Relationships**:\n   - The current set of actions lacks the necessary mechanisms to establish relationships between other pairs of objects (`object_1` & `object_2`, `object_2` & `object_3`, `object_3` & `object_0`). Without such actions, the goal remains unattainable.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThere is no valid sequence of the provided actions that can achieve the desired goal of establishing the relationships between `object_1` & `object_2`, `object_2` & `object_3`, and `object_3` & `object_0`.\n\n**Final Answer**:\nNo valid sequence of the provided actions can achieve the desired goal.",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Action Limitations**:\n   - **`j4gv801gnu2it0yj`** and **`wio5amhq7814n006`** are specifically designed to work with `object_0` and `object_1`. These actions can only create or manipulate the relationship between these two objects.\n   - There are no actions defined that allow you to directly create relationships between `object_1` and `object_2`, `object_2` and `object_3`, or `object_3` and `object_0`.\n\n2. **Cyclic Effects**:\n   - Attempting to use the available actions in sequence (e.g., performing `U64y1a9apusmslxb object_0` followed by `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1` and then `wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`) only cycles back to the original state without progressing toward the goal. This cycle prevents the creation of the additional required relationships.\n\n3. **No Mechanism for Additional Relationships**:\n   - The current set of actions lacks the necessary mechanisms to establish relationships between other pairs of objects (`object_1` & `object_2`, `object_2` & `object_3`, `object_3` & `object_0`). Without such actions, the goal remains unattainable.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThere is no valid sequence of the provided actions that can achieve the desired goal of establishing the relationships between `object_1` & `object_2`, `object_2` & `object_3`, and `object_3` & `object_0`.\n\n**Final Answer**:\nNo valid sequence of the provided actions can achieve the desired goal.",

None of the available actions can directly add this fact, nor can they be combined to infer it indirectly.\n\n4. **No Initial Actions are Applicable:**\n   - Given the current initial conditions, none of the actions can be performed because their preconditions are not met.

Here's an analysis of why:\n\n1. **Lack of Required Preconditions:**\n   - To perform the `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` action, you need the fact `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, which is **not** present in the initial conditions.\n   - To obtain `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, you would need to perform the `u64y1a9apusmslxb` action. However, this action requires `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, which is also **absent** from the initial conditions.\n\n2. **Cyclical Dependencies:**\n   - The actions that could potentially add or remove the necessary facts (`kip9uw781pv62umn` and `wio5amhq7814n006`) depend on facts that are either not present or cannot be established due to the missing prerequisites.\n\n3. **Unavailable Actions for Goal Facts:**\n   - The goal requires the fact `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_1`. None of the available actions can directly add this fact, nor can they be combined to infer it indirectly.\n\n4. **No Initial Actions are Applicable:**\n   - Given the current initial conditions, none of the actions can be performed because their preconditions are not met. This creates a deadlock where no progress can be made towards the goal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere is **no viable sequence of actions** that can be executed starting from the initial conditions to achieve the desired goal with the provided set of actions and restrictions.",

However, `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` is not present in the initial conditions and cannot be obtained because:\n     - To obtain `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, you would need to perform `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`, which itself requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`. \n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` is not part of the initial conditions and cannot be set without first having `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, creating a circular dependency.\n\n2. **Action Limitations:**\n   - **`u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`** cannot be performed initially because it requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, which is not available.\n   - **`kip9uw781pv62umn object_0`** also cannot be initiated without `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.\n   - **`wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`** requires `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1`, which is not present in the initial conditions.\n\n3. **Goal Achievement:**\n   - There are no actions that directly add the fact `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_2 object_3` to the state.\n   - Without the ability to manipulate the necessary preconditions, it's impossible to transition the state to include the desired goal.\n\n**Conclusion:** Given the current set of actions and initial conditions, you cannot formulate a valid sequence of actions to achieve the goal `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_2 object_3`.",

Here's a breakdown of why this is the case:\n\n### **Understanding the Goal and Requirements**\n\n- **Goal:** `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_2`\n\n- **Action to Achieve Goal:** \n  - **Action:** `J4gv801gnu2it0yj object_3 object_2`\n  - **Preconditions:** \n    - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`\n    - `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`\n  - **Effects After Action:**\n    - **Add:** `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_2`\n    - **Remove:** `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`, `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`\n\n### **Analyzing Preconditions**\n\n1. **`tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`**\n   - **Initial Conditions:** This fact is **not true** initially.\n   - **How to Achieve:** \n     - Only the `kip9uw781pv62umn` action can add `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`.\n     - **Precondition for `kip9uw781pv62umn object_2`:** `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2`\n     - **Issue:** There is **no action** that adds `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2` in the provided set of actions.\n\n2. **`a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`**\n   - **Initial Conditions:** This fact is **not true** initially.\n   - **How to Achieve:**\n     - The only actions that add `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_X` are:\n       - `u64y1a9apusmslxb` adds `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`\n       - `wio5amhq7814n006` adds `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`\n     - **Issue:** There is **no action** that adds `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`.\n\n### **Circular Dependency**\n\n- To perform `J4gv801gnu2it0yj object_3 object_2`, you need both `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`.\n- However, obtaining these preconditions themselves requires actions that are either not possible with the current facts or introduce a circular dependency where setting one precondition requires the other to be already set.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nGiven the current set of actions and initial conditions:\n\n- **There is no feasible sequence of actions** that can satisfy all the necessary preconditions to achieve the goal.\n- **Essential facts required** (`tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`) **cannot be established** with the provided actions.\n\n### **Recommendation**\n\nTo achieve the desired goal, you may need to:\n\n1. **Introduce Additional Actions:**\n   - Actions that can add `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`.\n\n2. **Modify Existing Actions:**\n   - Allow existing actions to manipulate a broader set of objects or add missing preconditions.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate Initial Conditions:**\n   - Ensure that some of the necessary preconditions are met from the start or can be established through available actions.\n\nWithout these modifications, reaching the goal as specified is unattainable with the current configuration.",

However, this fact is **not** present in the initial conditions, and there are no actions that can establish it without already having `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.\n   \n2. **Circular Dependency:**\n   - The actions required to establish `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (such as `u64y1a9apusmslxb` and `wio5amhq7814n006`) themselves depend on `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` being true. This creates a **circular dependency** with no starting point to break it.\n\n3. **Unavailable Preconditions for Other Actions:**\n   - Other actions like `wio5amhq7814n006` require certain facts (e.g., `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1`) that do not exist in the initial conditions and cannot be established without performing other actions that are themselves blocked by missing preconditions.\n\nGiven these constraints, **no sequence of actions** can be initiated from the provided initial conditions to reach the desired goal state.\n\n**Conclusion:** It is **impossible** to formulate a valid plan with the current set of actions and initial conditions to achieve the specified goal.",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Missing Preconditions for Actions:**\n   - To perform the `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` action, the fact `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` must be true. However, this fact is **not** present in the initial conditions, and there are no actions that can establish it without already having `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.\n   \n2. **Circular Dependency:**\n   - The actions required to establish `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (such as `u64y1a9apusmslxb` and `wio5amhq7814n006`) themselves depend on `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` being true. This creates a **circular dependency** with no starting point to break it.\n\n3. **Unavailable Preconditions for Other Actions:**\n   - Other actions like `wio5amhq7814n006` require certain facts (e.g., `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1`) that do not exist in the initial conditions and cannot be established without performing other actions that are themselves blocked by missing preconditions.\n\nGiven these constraints, **no sequence of actions** can be initiated from the provided initial conditions to reach the desired goal state.\n\n**Conclusion:** It is **impossible** to formulate a valid plan with the current set of actions and initial conditions to achieve the specified goal.",

The actions required to modify the facts necessary for your goal have unmet preconditions in the initial state, creating a deadlock that prevents any action from being performed.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - **Facts Present:** \n     - `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`\n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`\n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1`\n     - `af9tse23ljclsqad object_1`\n     - `af9tse23ljclsqad object_2`\n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_4`\n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_2`\n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_4 object_3`\n\n2. **Action Preconditions:**\n   - **`j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1`**\n     - Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1` (which is true)\n     - Requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (which is **false** initially)\n   - **`u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`**\n     - Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (true)\n     - Requires `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0` (which is **false** initially)\n     - Requires `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` (true)\n   - **`kip9uw781pv62umn object_0`**\n     - Requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (which is **false** initially)\n   - **`wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`**\n     - Requires `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1` (which is **false** initially)\n     - Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (true)\n     - Requires `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` (true)\n\n3. **Deadlock Situation:**\n   - To perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj`, you need `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, which requires performing `u64y1a9apusmslxb`. However, `u64y1a9apusmslxb` itself requires `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, which cannot be obtained because the only action that can provide it (`kip9uw781pv62umn`) requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`. This creates a circular dependency with no starting point.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no initial action can be performed to break this dependency cycle, it's impossible to progress towards the goal state with the given actions and initial conditions.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Review the initial conditions and action preconditions to ensure there are no missing facts or actions that could initiate the plan. You might need to add an initial fact or adjust the action requirements to create a feasible starting point.",

The actions required to modify the facts necessary for your goal have unmet preconditions in the initial state, creating a deadlock that prevents any action from being performed.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - **Facts Present:** \n     - `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`\n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`\n     - `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1`\n     - `af9tse23ljclsqad object_1`\n     - `af9tse23ljclsqad object_2`\n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_4`\n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_2`\n     - `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_4 object_3`\n\n2. **Action Preconditions:**\n   - **`j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1`**\n     - Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1` (which is true)\n     - Requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (which is **false** initially)\n   - **`u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`**\n     - Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (true)\n     - Requires `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0` (which is **false** initially)\n     - Requires `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` (true)\n   - **`kip9uw781pv62umn object_0`**\n     - Requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (which is **false** initially)\n   - **`wio5amhq7814n006 object_0 object_1`**\n     - Requires `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1` (which is **false** initially)\n     - Requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (true)\n     - Requires `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` (true)\n\n3. **Deadlock Situation:**\n   - To perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj`, you need `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, which requires performing `u64y1a9apusmslxb`. However, `u64y1a9apusmslxb` itself requires `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, which cannot be obtained because the only action that can provide it (`kip9uw781pv62umn`) requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`. This creates a circular dependency with no starting point.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since no initial action can be performed to break this dependency cycle, it's impossible to progress towards the goal state with the given actions and initial conditions.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Review the initial conditions and action preconditions to ensure there are no missing facts or actions that could initiate the plan. You might need to add an initial fact or adjust the action requirements to create a feasible starting point.",
