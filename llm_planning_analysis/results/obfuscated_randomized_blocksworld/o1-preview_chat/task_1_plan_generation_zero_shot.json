However, we cannot obtain `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` on `object_0` or `object_3` due to the lack of `af9tse23ljclsqad` on these objects and the structure of the actions.\n\n2. **Inability to Acquire Required Predicates**:\n   - The `u64y1a9apusmslxb` action, which adds `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` to an object, requires both `tv30k33pzoulql6w` and `af9tse23ljclsqad` on that object. We do not have `af9tse23ljclsqad` on `object_0` or `object_3`, nor can we obtain it because there is no action that adds `af9tse23ljclsqad` to an object without already having `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` (creating a circular dependency).\n   - The `kip9uw781pv62umn` action, which could add `af9tse23ljclsqad` to an object, requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk` as a precondition, which we cannot obtain for `object_0` or `object_3`.\n\n3. **Lack of Necessary `tv30k33pzoulql6w` Predicates**: To perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` on the required pairs (e.g., `object_0 object_2`), we need `tv30k33pzoulql6w` on `object_2`. There is no action available that adds `tv30k33pzoulql6w` to `object_2` given the initial conditions and without the predicates we cannot obtain.\n\n4. **Circular Dependencies and Action Limitations**: The actions provided create dependencies that cannot be resolved with the initial conditions. Each action's preconditions rely on predicates that cannot be established without first performing that same action or another action that also requires unreachable preconditions.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the available actions, there is no viable sequence of actions that leads to the goal. The predicates required to perform the necessary actions cannot be established due to the constraints and dependencies within the action definitions.\n\n**Answer**: There is no possible plan to achieve the goal with the given actions and initial conditions.",

Since none of the actions allow us to add `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` without already having `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`, and we can't get `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` without `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, we must assume that this fact is missing from the initial state.\n\n2. **Given the above assumption, we proceed as follows:**\n\n   - **Action:** `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`\n     - **Preconditions Met:** `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`\n     - **Effects:**\n       - **Add:** `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`\n       - **Delete:** `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`, `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`\n   \n   - **Action:** `kip9uw781pv62umn object_0`\n     - **Preconditions Met:** `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`\n     - **Effects:**\n       - **Add:** `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`, `af9tse23ljclsqad object_0`\n       - **Delete:** `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`\n\n   - At this point, we notice that we're back to the initial state. This indicates a loop where we're unable to progress toward the goal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the constraints and the actions available, it's not possible to achieve the goal state from the initial state provided. The main issue lies in the inability to establish `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` simultaneously, which is necessary to perform actions that would move us toward the goal. Therefore, no plan of actions can achieve the goal with the given initial conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** It's not possible to achieve the goal with the given actions and initial conditions; no plan can be formed.",

This action requires `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_1`. You now have `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_1` from step 1. However, you need `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`. Since `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2` is not in your initial conditions, you need to obtain it.\n\n3. Perform `kip9uw781pv62umn` on `object_2`. But before you can do this, you need `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2`. Repeat steps similar to step 1 for `object_2`:\n\n   - Perform `u64y1a9apusmslxb` on `object_2` to get `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2`.\n\n4. Now perform `kip9uw781pv62umn` on `object_2` to get `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`.\n\n5. With `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_1`, you can now perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` on `object_1` and `object_2`. This will make `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2` true.\n\n6. Next, perform `u64y1a9apusmslxb` on `object_0` to get `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0`.\n\n7. Perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` on `object_0` and `object_1`. You have `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_1` (from initial conditions) and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` (from step 6), so you can perform this action to make `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1` true.\n\n8. Perform `u64y1a9apusmslxb` on `object_3` to get `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`.\n\n9. Since `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` was made true in step 7, you can perform `j4gv801gnu2it0yj` on `object_3` and `object_0` to make `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_0` true.\n\nBy following these actions:\n\n1. `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_1`\n2. `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_1 object_2`\n3. `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_2`\n4. `kip9uw781pv62umn object_2`\n5. `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_1 object_2`\n6. `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_0`\n7. `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_0 object_1`\n8. `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_3`\n9. `j4gv801gnu2it0yj object_3 object_0`\n\nYou can achieve your goal of having `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_1`, `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2`, and `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_0` be true.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1.\u2003u64y1a9apusmslxb\u00a0object_1  \n2.\u2003j4gv801gnu2it0yj\u00a0object_1\u00a0object_2  \n3.\u2003u64y1a9apusmslxb\u00a0object_0  \n4.\u2003j4gv801gnu2it0yj\u00a0object_0\u00a0object_1  \n5.\u2003u64y1a9apusmslxb\u00a0object_3  \n6.\u2003j4gv801gnu2it0yj\u00a0object_3\u00a0object_0",

Preconditions require `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_y` and `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_x`.\n   - **u64y1a9apusmslxb object_x**: Produces `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_x` but deletes `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`, which is needed for other actions.\n   - **kip9uw781pv62umn object_x**: Restores `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` and `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_x` but requires `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_x`, which we might have lost in previous actions.\n   - **wio5amhq7814n006 object_x object_y**: Can add `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_y`, but it deletes existing `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn` facts, possibly including our goal facts.\n\n3. **Challenges**:\n   - Generating `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_2` is possible by first getting `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_0` and `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2`, but obtaining `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_2` is problematic due to circular dependencies in the actions' preconditions.\n   - Creating `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_0` is not feasible because we cannot simultaneously satisfy the preconditions required to generate this fact without violating other necessary conditions or losing other goal facts.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the actions available, there is no sequence of actions (plan) that can achieve all the goal facts. Specifically, the goal `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_3 object_0` cannot be achieved without violating the preconditions or effects required by the actions. Therefore, the answer is that there is no plan that can achieve the goals with the given constraints.\n\n**Answer**:\n\nThere is no plan that can achieve all the goals with the given actions and initial conditions.",

However, this action requires the precondition `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`, which you don't have.\n\nTo obtain `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`, you need to perform the action `u64y1a9apusmslxb object_3`. This action requires the precondition `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_3`, which you also don't have.\n\nAttempting to get `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_3` leads to a circular dependency:\n- Actions that add `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_3` (`j4gv801gnu2it0yj` and `kip9uw781pv62umn`) require `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_3`, which we can't obtain without `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_3`.\n\nAdditionally, any attempt to manipulate other objects to transfer necessary conditions either leads to the loss of `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_1 object_2` (which is required in your goal) or doesn't fulfill the necessary preconditions due to missing facts that can't be established under the rules provided.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGiven the constraints and the dependencies of the actions, there is no sequence of actions (plan) that can achieve your goal without violating the preconditions or losing necessary facts.

However, this requires `P(2)` and `S(1)` to be true.\n\nFrom the initial conditions, `P(2)` is not true, and neither is `S(1)`. You can attempt to get `S(1)` to be true by performing `Action B(1)`, which requires `P(1)`, `Q(1)`, and `R`. While `Q(1)` and `R` are initially true, `P(1)` is not. To get `P(1)` to be true, you might consider performing `Action D(0,1)`, but this will make `R` false, which is needed for `Action B(1)`.\n\nYou might attempt to regenerate `R` by performing `Action A(0,3)`, but this causes other necessary facts to become false. This pattern of circular dependencies continues, making it impossible to satisfy all preconditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven these constraints, it's not possible to achieve your goals with the available actions and initial conditions. The preconditions for the necessary actions cannot be met without invalidating other required conditions.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nNo plan is possible\u2014given the actions and initial conditions, you cannot achieve your goal.",

The goal is to have the fact `b6e9q4r60gagvdcn object_0 object_2` (which we'll call `B object_0 object_2`) be true, starting from the given initial conditions.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the actions and their interactions, it becomes clear that it's not possible to achieve the goal with the provided actions and initial conditions. Here's a summary of why:\n\n1. **Need for `A object_0`:** To perform actions that could lead to `B object_0 object_2`, we need `A object_0` to be true. However, there's no way to make `A object_0` true because all actions that add `A object_0` require preconditions that we cannot satisfy with the given initial facts.\n\n2. **Inability to Obtain `T object_0`:** Several actions require `T object_0` as a precondition. Again, there's no method to make `T object_0` true without already having `A object_0`, which we can't obtain.\n\n3. **Circular Dependencies:** The actions have circular dependencies that prevent progress. For example, to get `A object_0`, we need `T object_0`, but to get `T object_0`, we need `A object_0`.\n\n4. **No Actions to Bridge the Gap:** There are no available actions that can bridge the gap between the initial conditions and the required preconditions to perform the necessary actions for achieving the goal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nNo plan can achieve the goal given the initial conditions and the available actions.",

However, `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_2` is not true, and we cannot make it true with the actions available.\n   - Instead, we can perform `Kip9uw781pv62umn object_1` again (since `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_1` is true after Action 3), re-adding `cql4o62p1yeke3ok`.\n\n5. **J4gv801gnu2it0yj object_1 object_0**\n   - Preconditions: `a46zhwykn6jvbabk object_1` (true after Action 3) and `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0` (we need to establish this).\n   - To establish `tv30k33pzoulql6w object_0`, we needed Action 4, but since we couldn't perform it due to precondition issues, we have to conclude that with the given actions and initial conditions, it's not possible to achieve the goal.\n\nGiven the constraints and dependencies of the actions, it's not possible to achieve your goal with the provided actions and initial state.

The required preconditions for the necessary actions cannot be satisfied with the available facts and actions.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nTo achieve your goal, you may need to adjust the initial conditions or provide additional actions that can help bridge the gaps in the current dependencies.",

Since you cannot re-establish `cql4o62p1yeke3ok` after it's removed (because the action to add it back requires preconditions you cannot meet), progressing with such actions would prevent you from achieving the goal.\n\n4. **Circular Dependencies**:\n   - There are circular dependencies where obtaining one required fact depends on another that, in turn, depends on the first. This makes it impossible to proceed.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the actions available, there is no sequence of actions (plan) that can achieve your specified goal.
