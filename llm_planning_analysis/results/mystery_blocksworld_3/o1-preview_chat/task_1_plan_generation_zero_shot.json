However, Harmony becomes false, and object **b** no longer craves object **c**.\n\n- **Succumb object b**: Since object **b** is in pain after the first action, you can perform this action to restore Harmony, grant a province and planet to object **b**, and remove its pain.\n\n- **Attack object c**: With Harmony restored and object **c** having a province and planet, you can attack object **c**. This causes object **c** to experience pain and lose its province and planet, and Harmony becomes false again.\n\n- **Overcome object c from object b**: Now that object **c** is in pain, and object **b** has a province (from the Succumb action), you can perform this action.
